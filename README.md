# machine-learning
This repository is a collection of mini-projects on different machine learning algorithms. Most of the projects are part of my courses at IIT Delhi.
Each folder has documents -
1. *Assignment* - explains the problem statement and datasets.
2. *Report* - contains observations on the dataset and comparison of different models used
